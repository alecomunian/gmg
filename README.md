This is a public repository for the course of Geostatistical methods
for geophysics.  It contains some Jupyter Notebooks to explore the
content of the course with the support of Python.

## Browse the notebooks

The folder `notebooks` and its sub-folder contain some Jupyter
Notebooks regrouped by topic. By navigating into the folders and
selecting a notebook, you can visualize a *static* version of the
notebook and the corresponding results/plots. If you want to interact
with the script, you can download the notebook in your local machine,
and use `Jupyter Notebook` to open it in your favorite browser. To
download the notebook, you can for example select the "download raw
file" button that you can find on the right top corner of the GitHub
page of the specified notebook.

Alternatively, if you don't have any Python installation on your
computer or if your configuration does not allow to run some scripts,
please use the corresponding Binder instance (see the next section for
more info).

## Binder

If you want to run the notebooks on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/),
please use the following button:

Please be patient, as 5 or more minutes can be required to run create
and run the configuration files in the virtual machines created by
Binder.
